    <!-- Blog Post 1: US-China AGI Relations -->
    <article class="blog-post">
      <div class="blog-post-date">November 2025</div>
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">US-China AGI Relations and Diplomatic Interventions (2025-2030)</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        Over the next 1-5 years, I expect that the U.S.-China AGI relations will escalate because of three dynamics: (1) accelerated development of frontier AI, (2) China may increase its technical independence from U.S. export controls by producing domestic chips, (3) as AI systems become more autonomous they will become more opaque and harder to control.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        The main risk in US-China relations is unintentional escalation given that both nations will deploy frontier systems in military and other applications as soon as they become available. Technical failures could be misattributed as adversarial action which could trigger disproportionate responses before the U.S. and China do an investigation. Current diplomatic channels don't have the required technical mechanisms to help distinguish an AI malfunction from a deliberate attack.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        <strong>Intervention 1: Compute-Based Incident Reporting Protocol</strong><br>
        There are no AI-specific notification protocols between the U.S. and China. Deep mistrust makes traditional self-reporting incident mechanisms politically impossible. I propose tying incident reporting to compute signatures which are observable metrics that could be tracked through enhanced export controls (including chip activity, power consumption, cluster size, etc.). This would allow the U.S. and China to verify potential AI failures independently without exposing their strategic capabilities.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        <strong>Intervention 2: Joint Technical Standards</strong><br>
        I recommend joint technical standards to identify and benchmark dangerous AI capabilities. Establish bilateral working groups that are hosted by neutral third parties (ISO or IEEE) to develop shared benchmarks for capabilities that both nations would consider high-risk. This can include autonomous cyber offense, biological design, strategic deception, and/or autonomous weapons integration.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        <strong>Reporting Triggers:</strong> Tier 1 (24-hour notification): immediate safety threats, including AI-caused death or injury or models that demonstrate autonomous replication across distributed infrastructure. Tier 2 (48-hour notification): signal economic and/or infrastructure harm. This includes incidents during frontier-scale training runs (≥10²⁶ total FLOPs) that cause economic/infrastructure harm exceeding $100M.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        To see the most success, this proposal should be presented through bilateral channels and framed as operational safety cooperation, rather than arms control with an 18-month pilot to begin immediately. Embed this in chip export strategy where compute access is conditioned on reporting participation.

    <!-- Blog Post 2: Compute Controls -->
    <article class="blog-post">
      <div class="blog-post-date">November 2025</div>
      <h2 class="blog-post-title">Strengthening AI Chip Export Controls: Recommendations for Department of Commerce</h2>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        I recommend BIS adopt two interventions to close enforcement gaps: (1) tiered export licensing that is based on verification requirements, and (2) an embedded technical assessment capability at NIST AISI.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        <strong>Current Controls: Intent and Limitations</strong><br>
        BIS export AI chips controls use three mechanisms: performance-based thresholds which restrict advanced logic chips and high-bandwidth memory, end-use controls which target supercomputer and military applications, and expanded Foreign Direct Product Rule coverage of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Since the "AI Diffusion Rule" was rescinded in May 2025, controls focus on maintaining allied access while imposing targeted restrictions for China.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        However, there are three critical limits. First, BIS cannot effectively track chip location or deployment after export. China has reportedly acquired tens of thousands of H100-class chips through indirect channels despite controls. Second, current thresholds target chips optimized for training workloads, but AI development is shifting toward inference-heavy architecture. Third, control updates need 6-12 months from when the gap was identified to be implemented.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        <strong>Recommendation 1: Tiered Export Licensing Based on Verification Requirements</strong><br>
        A tiered approach would restructure controls around tiers based on end users' willingness to accept verification. Tier 1 would provide expedited licensing for advanced chips (e.g.: B200) to end users who would accept quarterly aggregate compute usage reporting, remote chip inventory verification, and network isolation. Tier 2 would provide standard licensing for current-generation chips to end users who would accept on-site inspections. Tier 3: end users who refuse verification would face presumptive denial.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
        <strong>Recommendation 2: Establish Rapid Technical Assessment Capability</strong><br>
        BIS lacks embedded technical expertise to anticipate how AI architectural development creates control vulnerabilities before adversaries exploit them. I propose to establish a small technical team (5-7 staff) in NIST's AI Safety Institute to stress-test regulations against emerging AI developments. This 'regulatory red team' could reduce the current 6-12 month implementation lag to weeks by continuously stress-testing controls against new AI developments.
