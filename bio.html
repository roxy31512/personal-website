    <h1>About Roxana Akhmetova</h1>

    <p>
      Roxana Akhmetova is an AI policy researcher and strategist focused on the governance of frontier AI systems and emerging technologies. She is currently an AI Safety Policy Fellow at Georgia Tech's AI Safety Initiative, where she tracks U.S. legislative and regulatory developments on semiconductor export controls, compute security, and dual-use technology governance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Roxana recently completed her doctorate at the University of Oxford, where her research examined AI governance frameworks and regulatory oversight of automated decision-making systems in government. Her work has been cited in the U.K. Government's Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability Framework for Automated Decision-Making (2024) and has directly informed policy consultations with Canadian immigration officials and border agencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before focusing on AI policy, Roxana founded and chaired the Oxford AI Gala, bringing together 250+ senior stakeholders including C-suite executives, government officials, and academic leaders. She also served as President of the Oxford Artificial Intelligence Society, leading Europe's largest AI student organization and securing a £60,000 Amazon research grant for AI bias research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her policy research spans AI governance frameworks, semiconductor policy, technology regulation, and comparative public policy analysis across the U.S., U.K., and Canada. She has presented her work at international conferences and has published research on AI in government decision-making, content moderation, and platform regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Roxana holds a DPhil and MSc in Migration Studies from the University of Oxford, and an MA in Political Studies from the University of Manitoba. She is a Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation Scholar, an honor awarded to the top 2.5% of doctoral candidates in Canada studying issues of public policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      She is passionate about building institutional capacity for responsible AI deployment, bridging technical and policy communities, and developing governance frameworks that can keep pace with rapidly advancing frontier AI systems.
