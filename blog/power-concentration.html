    <h1>AI-Enabled Power Concentration: Comparing Risks in Authoritarian Regimes and Democracies</h1>
    <div class="post-date">October 19, 2025</div>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>
        Both authoritarian regimes and democracies face risks from AI-enabled power concentration, though these threats
        manifest in different ways.
      </p>

      <p class="post-section-title"><strong>Risks in Authoritarian Regimes:</strong></p>
      <p>
        I think this risk is greater near-term in authoritarian regimes because it doesn't just make transitions messier —
        it can make them more likely to be violent. After a change in leadership (via coup or other means), the ex-leader's
        inner circle may remain as gatekeepers who built the surveillance and control infrastructure, and they may remain loyal
        to the ex-leader. A new leader may inherit those guards and the structural knowledge they hold; the ex-leader or old
        network might retain access they can weaponize even after losing formal power. That competition over control of an
        opaque, technically complex system can make internal coups or power struggles far more volatile.
      </p>

      <p>
        In authoritarian systems, leaders can negotiate with the military, party elites, and security services — buy them,
        remove them, or co-opt them. But with AI systems the question becomes: who controls the data, who controls the model?
        Data and baked-in biases are hard to change, and an AI that influences decisions can persist in ways that are difficult
        to dislodge or audit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regime failure may require more extreme suffering before collapse. If AI plays a central role in decision-making and
        operational control, it may tolerate higher dysfunctional thresholds before institutions visibly fail — a system that
        previously would collapse at 30% economic decline might persist until much deeper stress (for example, 50%+), because
        the automated systems continue to operate and mask emergent breakdowns.
      </p>

      <p class="post-section-title"><strong>Risks in Democracies:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Democracies have formal mechanisms to remove unjust laws or corrupt officials, but an algorithm that becomes progressively
        more biased via feedback loops presents a different challenge: legitimacy failure without a clear antagonist. It's harder
        to protest an algorithm than a person — when harms are mediated by an optimisation routine that appears to be 'just
        serving preferences,' public recourse and accountability become blurred.
      </p>

      <p>
        Information gaps and sophisticated synthetic information generated by AI can also erode democratic processes, worsening
        polarization, degrading shared facts, and reducing the capacity of institutions to respond effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Western democracies — especially the U.S. — grant access to advanced AI chips to authoritarian regimes, they risk
        creating structural dependencies. Authoritarian states might become reliant on Western infrastructure for critical
        strategic technology. Conversely, restricting access can accelerate autarkic development: denying chips today may
        incentivize faster domestic semiconductor buildup tomorrow. Either path has geopolitical costs — dependence or a
        faster, disorderly arms-race in semiconductors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Democracies are intentionally deliberative and slow, while AI systems move fast. This temporal mismatch risks degrading
        democratic governance capacity and legitimacy if institutions cannot adapt to machine-scale decision processes.
      </p>
