    <h1>A Quarterly Evaluation Sprint Program for Frontier AI Safety</h1>
    <div class="post-date">October 25, 2025</div>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>
        Small, like-minded countries—the UK, Japan, Canada, and Singapore—could build trust and shared capacity 
        on frontier AI safety through a modest but practical cooperative step. 
        Rather than duplicating the UN or G7, I propose a quarterly evaluation sprint program.
      </p>

      <p>
        These four countries already have established AI safety institutes, democratic governance structures, 
        and an interest in coordinating without US or Chinese leadership. 
        Each country would test frontier models deployed in its jurisdiction against an agreed set of safety benchmarks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each sprint would focus on one specific risk domain: biosecurity misuse, cyber offensive capabilities, 
        deceptive alignment, or autonomous replication and resource acquisition. 
        Member countries would evaluate their domestic models using standardised protocols 
        developed collectively by the group.
      </p>

      <p>
        This design can help reduce risks and improve coordination by addressing three main challenges. 
        First, it builds shared technical language and standards. 
        Currently, when regulators discuss “dangerous capabilities,” they may mean different things operationally. 
        By conducting parallel evaluations with standardised protocols, 
        countries can develop common metrics and risk thresholds to enable meaningful cross-border policy dialogue. 
        If one country proposes restrictions based on evaluation results, 
        others can assess whether similar restrictions should apply in their jurisdictions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, it builds trust without requiring labs to share model weights. 
        This is important because labs often resist international cooperation 
        out of fear of exposing intellectual property or losing competitive advantage. 
        As countries conduct evaluations on their own infrastructure, 
        they share only three categories of information: evaluation methodologies and prompting strategies, 
        results showing whether models passed or failed safety thresholds, 
        and lessons about evaluation design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, if done well, participating countries will build cumulative institutional knowledge. 
        Each sprint would document failure modes and lessons about effective evaluation methods. 
        This prevents duplication, where each country independently discovers the same issues. 
        It also builds regulatory capacity so agencies can develop in-house expertise 
        in frontier model testing rather than depending solely on labs’ self-assessments. 
        The program may also promote responsible scaling by reducing uncertainty 
        about international regulatory expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        A rotating team of 2–3 researchers from participating AI safety institutes 
        could coordinate methodology development, publication schedules, and synthesis of findings. 
        After one year (covering multiple risk domains), 
        the coalition could publish a joint frontier evaluation playbook documenting where evaluation methods converged, 
        diverged, and what those differences reveal about current testing paradigms. 
        Core participants would include national AI safety agencies (UK AISI, Japan AIST, Canada ISED, Singapore AISG) 
        and domestic frontier labs participating voluntarily. 
        Governments could create incentives through procurement preferences 
        or liability safe harbours for companies that submit to cooperative evaluation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This framework could eventually extend to if-then commitments where countries agree on responses to capability thresholds— 
        for example: “If models demonstrate capability X in our tests, then we collectively implement restriction Y.” 
        Such conditional agreements could reduce arms race dynamics by enabling coordinated, predictable responses.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two sprints (6 months), participating agencies would evaluate feasibility 
        and whether cross-country comparisons yield useful insights. 
        This mid-year checkpoint would determine whether to continue the project. 
        After four sprints, success could mean completing evaluations across four risk domains 
        and publishing a joint playbook. 
        If a second year begins and at least one new country joins, 
        it would demonstrate growing trust and impact. 
        Success would also mean that labs found the process less burdensome than expected 
        and considered the protocols technically sound.
