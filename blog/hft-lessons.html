    <h1>Lessons from High-Frequency Trading for AI Governance</h1>
    <div class="post-date">September 29, 2025</div>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>
        I chose high-frequency trading as a case study. As algorithmic tools became more popular between the 2000s and 2010s, 
        the finance world adopted autonomous trading systems — algorithmic decision rules and statistical models — to make and 
        cancel orders at microsecond to millisecond timescales. These algorithms could exploit tiny price discrepancies and make rapid decisions based on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        No single institution had visibility of these automated interactions. Regulators faced severe informational asymmetry because trading firms' algorithms were proprietary, 
        making it nearly impossible to audit their behavior. Governance mechanisms operated on human and bureaucratic timescales, 
        while market dynamics unfolded in microseconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, human oversight was nearly impossible, and established control mechanisms were ill-equipped for this new technology. 
        In 2010, a “flash crash” lasted only a few minutes but wiped out billions in market value. 
        Safeguards at the time assumed humans were in the loop, but there were no mechanisms capable of intervening at machine speed. 
        Regulators couldn’t respond in real time, and markets lacked automated safety locks designed for microsecond-scale decision systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the crash, regulators introduced circuit breakers and market controls to pause trading if prices moved too quickly, 
        and to limit cascading order cancellations. Post-crash reforms also established joint monitoring protocols 
        and data-sharing between regulators and exchanges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, advanced AIs are now outpacing regulation. The 2010 flash crash showed that when systems operate faster than human oversight, 
        we need preventive, automated safety locks. AI regulation today risks being reactive — waiting for a crisis before acting. 
        Frontier AI systems may require “AI circuit breakers,” capability registries, mandatory audit trails, shared telemetry, 
        automated oversight layers, or transnational safety boards that can intervene at machine speed before harms occur.
      </p>

      <p>
        Market incentives must also evolve to reward safety over speed and profit. 
        Design mechanisms could include trading fees for ultra-fast strategies, liability for cascading failures, 
        or mandatory safety certifications for automated systems.
      </p>
